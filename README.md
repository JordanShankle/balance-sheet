This is a project I did while first learning to code. I did it as part of the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum.

In this project, I learned how to use pseudo selectors in CSS, how to style elements so when I hover over them it changes, & trigger other events on my webpage. 

Here is the url source for this project: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-more-about-css-pseudo-selectors-by-building-a-balance-sheet/step-1
